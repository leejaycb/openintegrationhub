## Introduction

The Open Integration Hub is a framework based on a microservice architecture. For a reference implementation please visit the [services folder](services). You can also customize services and combine them with your own technology. If you want to do so please visit the [lib folder](lib). There you will find `"daos"` that can be used to add your own functionality (e.g. [queues manager](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/openintegrationhub/blob/master/lib/component-orchestrator/src/QueuesManager.js#L2)).

## Join the Community

## Run it

You may run the framework or single services on a platform of your choice. As a refrence and to make it easier for you to get started we created two guides for you.

[Local Setup](https://openintegrationhub.github.io/docs/3%20-%20GettingStarted/LocalInstallationGuide.html) with minikube or docker-compose.
